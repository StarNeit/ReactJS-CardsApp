Cards App (NodeJS+ReactJS+FLUX)
=====


I'm building a Cards app (like Trello) with the main motivation of trying the following tech. stack:

- NodeJS (for the API and the Web App)
- FLUX for the data flow architecture
- ReactJS (for the view layer)
- Webpack (for enabling common js on the web app)
- Handlebars (using hbs to enable some sugar with partials and other stuff from Handlebars)
- Stylus (my css precompiler)
